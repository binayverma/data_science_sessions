Kick start Session to Transition in Data Science.


# Origin of Data Science/ Inspiration

Information/Data is there all around us. It's been there for millenniums.

They way wind moves or water behaves or why Ice floats or continents move or birds fly or fish swim and animals walk. These are no simple things for a child and are not that complex for a human to understand.

But how do you express things? It when we started calibrating things. We started measuring temperate, water level, rain fail,.. so on. Now we understand if you say that temperated at X is 40 degree C or you say -40 degree C. But if you keep saying hold or cold - its relative information to one's perception. It difficult.

Now because this information is noted precisely, people started using math to understand these things. Some are Newton, Einstein, Tesla,.. so on.

All Newton or Einstein or Tesla did was to formulate these. How did you do? Gathered information, did several repetitions and concluded those observations. We call it Science.

As Science has also enabled to store large amounts of information, we are in a world we can use years of experience of those our predecessors & live a better life.

Do you know Edison, is the 16th person to invent a bulb? Yes there were 16 others were there but Edison happen to find a cheaper way to make it.

Now do you really think, Newton found gravity because Apple fell on him? I don't. It's storytelling to help you remember core concepts of Gravity.

# Now here is the question. Lets know about a bit more.
