# Workshop


Goal of this session is to make you understand the basic steps to start using machine learning. You don't need to know much to understand a simple Linear Equation ( y = m * x + c). As a matter of fact, these Linear Equation or Linear Regression are one of the top notch know & used Machine Learning Models.

So why delay, start exploring these notebooks.


LR1: Contains simple Linear Regression Example

LR2: Contains another Linear Regression Example to show case its limitations.

LR3: Contains a real world example & along with other models to compare.
